## Motivation

Common photo-editing apps like iPhone Photos or Instagram offer plenty of filters- but don't include the full spectrum of options. **FilterForge** was born out of a desire to explore more ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù photographic transformations, letting you tweak and combine effects you don‚Äôt see every day.  

***Any suggestions for new filters are very much appreciated. See [Contributing](#contributing) below.***

## Features

- **Upload & Preview**: Drag or select an image to instantly preview filters.  
- **Adjustable Intensity**: Fine-tune each filter‚Äôs strength on a 0‚Äì100 scale.  
- **Multiple ‚ÄúUncommon‚Äù Filters**: Explore effects like Infrared, Polarizer, Dual-Color and more.  
- **Download**: Export your filtered image with one click.  
- **Responsive UI**: Built with modern React components for a sleek experience.
